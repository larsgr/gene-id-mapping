# Cross-Assembly Gene ID Mapping Workflow

## Overview

This project aims to develop a bioinformatics workflow for mapping gene annotations across genome assemblies. The primary goal is to convert gene IDs from one assembly to another (e.g., from an older to a newer assembly) with accompanying metadata on mapping confidence and annotation similarity.

This workflow will ultimately be used to generate mapping tables for [**Salmobase**](https://salmobase.org), but this repository also serves as a lab notebook documenting tool evaluation, experiments, and methodology.

---

## Goals

- Automatically generate gene ID mappings between genome assemblies.
- Report similarity metrics between gene models (e.g., % CDS overlap, % exon overlap).
- Detect and warn about ambiguous mappings (e.g., non-1:1 relationships).
- Output metadata for confidence scoring and visualization (e.g., green/yellow/red icons).
- Document tool evaluations, findings, and rationale behind design decisions.

## Related Issues & Context

This project is related to following issues in the [Salmobase repo](https://gitlab.com/elixir-nmbu/salmobase) 
- [#112 ID conversion tool](https://gitlab.com/elixir-nmbu/salmobase/-/issues/112)
- [#111 Cross assembly annotation links](https://gitlab.com/elixir-nmbu/salmobase/-/issues/111)
- [#79 Cross annotation links improvements](https://gitlab.com/elixir-nmbu/salmobase/-/issues/79)

Initial strategies from these issues include:
- Compare exon/CDS coordinates for overlap-based similarity.
- Provide mapping confidence metadata (tooltips, color indicators).
- Highlight non-1:1 matches for manual review or exclusion.

## Tool Candidates

Gemini deep research was used to identify relevant existing tools ([full report here](docs/tool-survey.md))

Existing relevant tools identified:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **GffCompare** | Annotation comparison within a single assembly. |
| **Liftoff / LiftoffTools** | Cross-assembly mapping with a promising "variants" module. |
| **ExOrthist** | Identifies orthologous exons across species/assemblies. |
| **ParsEval** | Compares alternative annotations. |
| **GeneOverlapAnnotator** | Part of SVAnnotator, returns gene/transcript overlap stats. |

We will begin by experimenting with **LiftoffTools**, given its relevance and capabilities.

## Roadmap

1. ✅ Research candidate tools.
2. 🟡 Create toy dataset for initial testing.
3. 🟡 Experiment with LiftoffTools and document findings.
4. ⬜ Evaluate other tools as needed.
5. ⬜ Develop and test mapping workflow (e.g., Snakemake or Nextflow).
6. ⬜ Integrate with Salmobase outputs.
7. ⬜ Generate final documentation and publish results.

## The toy-assembly dataset (data/toy-assemblies)

The both copies of the HoxC A cluster from two versions of Atlantic salmon reference genome (Ssal_v3.1 and ICSASG_v2) and Rainbow trout (Omyk) was extracted as a small dataset to use for testing.

The corresponding gff for these regions must be extracted. The scripts to do this must be created. In progress... See [docs/creating-toy-dataset.md](docs/creating-toy-dataset.md) for more details and progress.




## Getting Started

To begin experimenting:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/larsgr/gene-id-mapping.git
   cd gene-id-mapping
   ```

2. **Set up the development environment**:

   Create the conda environment from the provided file:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate idmap
   ```

3. **Explore experiments**:

   * Go to `experiments/liftoff_test/` and try out the first test runs using toy datasets.
